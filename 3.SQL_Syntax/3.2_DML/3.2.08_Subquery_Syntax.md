### 3.2.8 Subquery 

#### 3.2.8.1 The Subquery as Scalar Operand

For example :  

    SELECT (SELECT s2 FROM t1);  
    SELECT (SELECT s1 FROM t2) FROM t1;  
    SELECT UPPER((SELECT s1 FROM t1)) FROM t2;  

 

#### 3.2.8.2 Comparisons Using Subqueries

The most common use of a subquery is in the form:

	non_subquery_operand comparison_operator (subquery)

Where comparison_operator is one of these operators:

	=    >    <    >=    <=    <>    !=    <=>

MySQL also permits this construct:

	non_subquery_operand LIKE (subquery)

#### 3.2.8.3 Subqueries with ANY, IN, or SOME

Syntax:

	operand comparison_operator ANY (subquery)
	operand IN (subquery)
	operand comparison_operator SOME (subquery)

 

Where comparison_operator is one of these operators:

	=    >    <    >=    <=    <>    !=

#### 3.2.8.4 Subqueries with ALL

Syntax:

	operand comparison_operator ALL (subquery)

#### 3.2.8.5 Subqueries with EXISTS or NOT EXISTS

For example:

	SELECT column1 FROM t1 WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM t2);

Not support Correlated Subqueries for now.

 

#### 3.2.8.6 Derived Tables (Subqueries in the FROM Clause)

	SELECT ... FROM (subquery) [AS] tbl_name ...
